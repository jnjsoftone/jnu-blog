###  Purpose

- To create a web version of the classic Windows Minesweeper game that I frequently played.
- To understand that, while the game appears simple on the surface, its internal implementation can be challenging.
- To implement the game using plain JavaScript without relying on external libraries.

### Tech Stack

> HTML, CSS, Javascript

### Main Features

- Map Generation
  - Accepts input for the map size (x, y) and the number of mines (z).
- Mouse Click
  - Left Click: Opens the selected cell. If a mine is present, the game ends.
  - Right Click: Places a flag and shows the remaining mine count.
- Opened Cells
  - Displays the number of surrounding mines for the selected cell.
  - If the surrounding mine count is 0, all adjacent cells open.
- Dashboard
  - Displays elapsed time, remaining mine count, and the number of safe cells.
