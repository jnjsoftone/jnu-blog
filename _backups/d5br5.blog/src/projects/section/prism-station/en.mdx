### Insights

- As a developer, there seemed to be many shortcomings and a mountain of additional features to implement, but many people used the service. While raising the completion level is important, ensuring that the overall functions work smoothly already accounts for more than half the success.
- The user count per page indicated that map view users were more than ten times higher than list view users. The list page turned out to be unnecessary from a UI/UX perspective. Removing the list view and enhancing the map view would be cleaner and more convenient for consumers. Focus and prioritization are necessary.
