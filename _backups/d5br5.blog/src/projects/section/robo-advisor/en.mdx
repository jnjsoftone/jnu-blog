### Overview

- A portfolio creation simulator considering various assets like stocks and bonds.
- Composed of two main services:
    - Asset Allocation: How should the proportions of the currently held stocks have been adjusted to maximize returns?
    - Trading: Regardless of the stock, how will my trading strategy perform after one year?
- Submit simulation information and the connected AI model generates analysis results.
- Review the history of conducted simulations to inform actual investment decisions.
